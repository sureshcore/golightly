golightly
=========

Golightly is a lightweight implementation of google's "go" programming language. It's
based on the famously lightweight and fast Lua virtual machine.

Golightly is designed for embedding in other programs as a scripting language, offering the
elegant design and power of Go with the convenience of scripting.

It's currently in development - not usable at this stage.
